# Decentralized_Data_Sharing
## Introduction :
This project aims to create a decentralized system for storing and sharing health data. By using blockchain technology, we can ensure that data is secure and can only be accessed by authorized parties.

## Technical details
The system will be built using the Ethereum blockchain, and data will be stored on IPFS. Users will be able to connect to the system using a web3-enabled browser, such as MetaMask. Data will be encrypted and stored in a decentralized manner, with only authorized parties having access to the decryption keys.

## Features 
-Data encryption
-Data sharing with authorized parties
-Data access through web3-enabled browser
-Data immutability through blockchain technology

## Future developments
-Integration with existing health systems
-AI-based data analysis
-Providing incentives for users who contribute data
-Adding more data types and fields
